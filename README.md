# Learning Git
Testing ground for me to learn Git.

Seeing as how I've never done this before I'd like to really get to it.

1. Got cloning down. And push via ssh for that matter.

2. Did some branching and merging. oh, and this update came from my phone via Working Copy.

3. This line item, if successful the way I intend, will have been the result of a pull request.

4. This is all done by memory using branches and push and pull requests.
