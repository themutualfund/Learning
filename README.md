# Learning Git
Testing ground for me to learn Git.

Seeing as how I've never done this before I'd like to really get to it.

1. Got cloning down. And push via ssh for that matter.

2. Did some branching and merging. oh, and this update came from my phone via Working Copy.

3. This line item, if successful the way I intend, will have been the result of a pull request.

4. This is all done by memory using branches and push and pull requests.

5. This was done with a branch and a CLI pull request.

6. This is showing Dakota branching.

7. Yet another branch with Dakota, but this time new from the start.

8. Showing Dakota Working Copy

9. This is a test of Textastic integrating with Working Copy.

10. Another of 9.

11. A quick one before work from my phone, Textastic, and Working Copy.
